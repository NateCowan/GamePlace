# GamePlace

<h3>Application Description</h3>
Our application, GamePlace, is a video game analysis website. Users will be prompted to make a login to become a member of GamePlace. Once logged in, users are able to explore the different video games that our site has data on, and even help contribute their own reviews! 
Our data will be shown to the user through different parts of the website. When looking at the home screen we will have different featured cards of video games that hold more information when clicked on. We will also have a search and explore page. Users can use the search bar to find a game theyâ€™d like to know more about, or they can discover a new game based on a selected genre. Not only this, but users are able to create their own reviews on a game and read other people in the community's reviews as well.
